## Personal Site

Welcome to the mess that is the codebase of my personal site.

Being very experimental in nature, there are plenty of code snippets and assets that are commented out and simply not in use.

I'm iteratively working on this and if there is an already published version, it is probably just because I felt that I needed to have something
out rather than just improving _ad eternum_ without ever launching it.
